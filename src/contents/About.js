            <p>I started my journey in the world of computers from an young age,
            now Iâ€™m 20 years old, Pursuing my Bachelor of Engineering Degree in
            SNS College of Engineering.  Web development and Full Stack Development is my center of interest, I always
            love the idea of cross-platform development, 1-n one code base deploy into almost
            any platform, which web technology like Javascript enables me to do. I also like
            creating Interactive UI components for better UX and develop Data Science projects based 
            on the packages of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning and share those design and codes
            to the world through Github and Instagram.
